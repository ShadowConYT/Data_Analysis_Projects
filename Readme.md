## Introduction

In this project, we aim to analyze TV data and investigate Netflix movies to gain insights and understand trends in the entertainment industry. By performing EDA, we can uncover patterns, relationships, and interesting findings in the data.

## Data

The data used in this project includes TV show datasets and Netflix movie datasets. These datasets provide information such as titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more. The datasets are included in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Analysis

The analysis process involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, exploring various aspects of the datasets, and visualizing the findings. We will use Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be presented in the form of visualizations, statistical summaries, and key insights. These findings will provide a deeper understanding of the TV industry and Netflix movies, including popular genres, trends over time, and other interesting patterns.

## Usage

To use the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to execute the analysis code.
